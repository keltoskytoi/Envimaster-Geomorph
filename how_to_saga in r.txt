### prepare

- check ur SAGA version. the script needs 2.0.4 - 2.2.3
- i use 2.1.2
- load the basic head script and use "linkSAGA()"
- if u can choose a version u have more than one <- check ur system and delete 
unneeded version and leave only 1. If u have problems try use the OSgeo4shell to 
identifie installed versions and re/uninstall

### get started
- use the "with saga" head script to load new environment
- if u get no question for choosing a version u are rdy to go

- now RSAGA wrapper can be used OR soon coming R Wrapper function by me :)
