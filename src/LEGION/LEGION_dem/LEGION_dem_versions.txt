### LEGION dem

used to compute several artifically layers from a single dem

## V1 returns a rasterbrick

## V1.1 adds simple filter function

## V1.2 adds a loop to run over filter

## V1.3 uses a sf to stack returning list from loop

## V1.4 uses longer names for rasters and in first run computes without filter and filter tag
	if filters is missing returns stack for unfiltered dem, if filters is single or seq runs
	over filters and returns a stack with untagged (first step) and filter tagged rasterlayers
